## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API
and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file.
You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with
the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to
customized perfection.

## Development

If you want to continue coding you need to have `nodejs and npm` locally
installed. You can check that by running `node -v && npm -v` in the terminal,
which should result in two versions shown in the terminal.

Once `nodejs and npm` installed you simple run `npm start` which runs a express
server locally and serves the static files. In addition in enables two
endpoints. One is a get for projectdata and the second for post projectdata.
